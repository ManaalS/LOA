<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<h2>General Game Rules</h2>
<p>  It is played on a checkerboard with ordinary checkers pieces. The two players take turns, each moving a piece, and possibly capturing an opposing piece. The goal of the game is to get all of oneâ€™s pieces into one group of pieces that are connected. Two pieces are connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Play alternates between Black and White, with Black moving first. Each move consists of moving a piece of your color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally onto an empty square or onto a square occupied by an opposing piece, which is then removed from the board. A piece may jump over friendly pieces (without disturbing them), but may not cross enemy pieces, except one that it captures. A piece must move a number of squares that is exactly equal to the total number of pieces (black and white) on the line along which it chooses to move (the line of action). This line contains both the squares behind and in front of the piece that moves, as well as the square the piece is on. A piece may not move off the board, onto another piece of its color, or over an opposing piece.</p>
<p> The game ends when one side's pieces are contiguous: that is, there is a path connecting any two pieces of that side's color by a sequence of steps to adjacent squares (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), each of which contains a piece of same color. Hence, when a side is reduced to a single piece, all of its pieces are contiguous. If a move causes both sides' pieces to be contiguous, the winner is the side that made that move. One can have infinite games, where players just repeat positions indefinitely. We will prevent this with a move-limit rule: if the current move limit is L moves (the default is 60), then after the two sides both make L moves combined, the game ends in a tie. Our testing will always include time limits; somebody will eventually lose if two players repeat positions many times.</p>

<h2> How to Play from my GUI</h2>
<p>In order to move one of your pieces, you just need to click on a square that has your piece. If you dont like the square you picked, just click it again and it should desselect it, and you can choose another. Then click where you want to go. Make sure its a legal move. </p>
<p> To capture a piece, just click on it </p>
<p> If you try to make an illegal move, it won't work. Stop. Don't do it. Don't think you're smart. My program is smarter than you. </p>
<p>To undo a move click "Game Options" and then "undo." Note that this will undo the last round (the last two moves, one from each player). Also in that menu, you can start a new game by clicking "new" and close the game by clicking "quit." But don't quit or restart just because you're losing because then you're still a loser.  </p>
<p>If you want to play a two human-player game, simply click on "Player Options" and then "Manual Black" or "Manual White." Similarly, if you'd like the computer to play for a player, then click "Auto White" or "Auto Black." By default, black player is a human player and white player is the computer. </p>
<p>If it's your turn, then it will say so under the menu, like "black, your move!". If a player wins, it will say so in the same spot. And if you tie, then it will say "-" instead of "white" or "black." Because neither won :( </p>
<p>If you are confused about the instructions, you can click "Game Information" at the top, and then click "Help." Don't worry, it can be a confusing game. I get it. </p>
