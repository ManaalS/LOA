LOA CS61B, Version 2.0.
</p>

<p>
Hello! My name is Manaal Siddiqui. I'm a student at UC Berkeley studying computer science (hopefully, I'm technically still undeclared). This is an implementation of a version of the board game Lines of Action. It was one of our projects for CS 61B this semester. Hope you enjoyed! If you're a TA, you should like, comment, subscribe, and give me EC :P
